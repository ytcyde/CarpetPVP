# Included fixes for Carpet fake players:

- Fixed reach values for creative and survival fake players
- Attacking always swings and resets cooldown regardless of target
- Fixed buggy shield behavior and KB
- Using items like consumables, bows, shields, etc. now slows down the bot the proper amount
- Crouching no longer stops sprinting
- Starting a continuous action no longer stops any previous continuous actions of the same type
- Added `stopm` player subcommand to stop player movement without affecting continuous actions, allowing full control of movement while using items
